# os-C

This project seeks to create an easy, standard, way for applications written in the C programming language to interact with an Openstack enviroment.Seeing how I am only one person, and a busy person at that, we will see how far I get with this.

# openrc.c #

This file must be updated with the values unique to your enviroment. Think of this as your openrc file that you 'source' when using the Openstack
CLIs.
